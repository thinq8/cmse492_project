# Predicting League of Legends Outcomes (CMSE 492 Project)

This repository scaffolds the CMSE 492 final project, where we forecast League of Legends match outcomes using team statistics from the first ten minutes. It provides a clean project skeleton, preliminary exploratory analysis, and a baseline model so future milestones—feature engineering, advanced modeling, interpretability, and reporting—can layer on without restructuring.

- `data/raw/` contains the source dataset (`high_diamond_ranked_10min.csv`) retrieved from Kaggle's *League of Legends Diamond Ranked Games (10 min)* collection. The file stays out of version control—download it locally before running analysis.
- `data/processed/` stores derived artifacts such as descriptive statistics, split metadata, and other lightweight outputs generated by the EDA pipeline.
- `notebooks/exploratory/` holds executed notebooks, beginning with the preliminary EDA and baseline classifier for Part B of the assignment.
- `src/` is reserved for production-ready preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation code as the project matures.
- `figures/` aggregates static plots generated during exploration for reuse in reports and slide decks.
- `docs/` keeps course handouts, templates, and planning notes.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create a Python environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Download the Kaggle dataset**
   - Install the Kaggle CLI and place your API token in `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` (see Kaggle docs).
   - Run:
     ```bash
     kaggle datasets download -d bobbyscience/league-of-legends-diamond-ranked-games-10-min
     unzip league-of-legends-diamond-ranked-games-10-min.zip -d data/raw
     ```
   - Confirm the CSV `high_diamond_ranked_10min.csv` exists under `data/raw/`.
4. **Reproduce the exploratory analysis**
   ```bash
   python src/preprocessing/run_eda.py
   ```
   The script performs an 80/20 stratified split, saves descriptive summaries to `data/processed/`, and exports plots to `figures/eda/`.

## Exploratory Data Highlights

- Train split contains 7,903 matches and the test split 1,976 matches (80/20 stratified on `blueWins`).
- Class balance remains essentially even (49.9% blue wins), so no resampling is required at this stage.
- No missing values were observed across the 39 numeric features supplied in the Kaggle dataset.
- Economic and experience differentials (`blueGoldDiff`, `blueExperienceDiff`, and their red counterparts) show the strongest correlations with the outcome.
- Outlier rates stay below 1.3% for the inspected advantage metrics, indicating that standard models can likely handle the raw scale without aggressive trimming.
- Visual assets (`class_balance.png`, `feature_distributions.png`, `objective_control.png`, `top_feature_correlation_heatmap.png`) live in `figures/eda/` for direct inclusion in the report.

## Collaboration Checklist

- Push this repository to GitHub as `cmse492_project` and add collaborators `lucianogsilvestri` (instructor) and `maryambrj` (TA) if the repo remains private.
- Commit subsequent milestones frequently so proposal drafts, modeling experiments, and reports are clearly versioned.

## Next Steps

- Transition the exploratory findings into modular preprocessing and modeling code under `src/`.
- Baseline multiple classifiers (logistic regression, tree ensembles, neural network) using the documented split metadata.
- Draft the LaTeX report with figures and tables generated by `src/preprocessing/run_eda.py`.
